    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class="summary">Welcome to my website!</p>
    <p class="summary">
      You can find what is essentially an up-to-date résumé, including my full
      background, some of my interests, and a way to contact me. The bottomline
      is that my first job was in tech (a network admin for a small business). I
      loved it, but through college and the military, I wound up going into
      Human Resources. In 2020, I had the opportunity to try and switch careers
      and I chose Software Development from the prestigious (a top 50 U.S.
      university!) Boston University to try and learn more advanced programming
      and break further into the tech field. Beyond that, a short summary is
      available about me below.
    </p>
    <p class="summary">
      Highly educated, decorated military officer veteran with over 10 years of
      professional experience. Diplomatic, personable, and adept at managing
      sensitive situations. Highly organized, self-motivated, and proficient
      with computers and systems, with a keen eye for detail. Willing to share
      all performance evaluations to prove excellence with potential employers.
