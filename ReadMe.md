# CS 601 Assignment 2

### Marcus Andrew Acord-Serventi

### Summary

I've only been coding for about a year now (exclusively through coursework at Boston University) so for my first real foray into HTML/CSS, I wanted to keep it simple. Basically, I want to take my résumé and translate that into a webpage. The HW from week 1 and week 2 should form the basis for my final course project. For week 2, I spent a solid 9+ hours on this assignment, learning HTML, learning CSS, fixing code from week 1, and playing with it to get a somewhat acceptable appearance. I'm still not happy overall with the way it looks, but I will fix it on the final project, which should look a lot better (thinking of diving into grid or flexbox to help with the layout - wanted to learn the basics this week without it first). I think I can greatly use flexbox to improve the layout and feel of the website for the final project (especially on the nav bar). I also want to include some more hover over mouse animations, especially on the navigation, but first steps first (and the nav bar will need to be recreated in JS anyway).

### Assignment Overview

1. Fixed a lot of the bugs from last week. I double checked my code through the browser instead of my Live Server and it worked fine. The images loaded and the navigation links all worked. Also added tons of additional HTML5 semantic tags throughout (some, however, would not work, so I had to do a few div with classname specified)

2. Changed the easter egg page to a general interest page. Still need to flesh it out a lot. Added some stuff too - learned how to embed Youtube videos directly onto the website (iframes suck - it gets blocked by my browser, but embed worked), so I spent some time tinkering with that.

3. Added the CSS and played around with the overall look and layout of the website a LOT. At first, I was using px to specify paddings and other things, but I eventually learned % was generally more effective for larger padding and px was only for small padding. Images fade out when hovered over. The background and footer took a fair bit of trial and error to get right.

4. Added 3 distinct views for the assignment requirement (which requires 3 distinct differences in presentation through media queries). The base view for desktops. A print view for printers removes the images, video, audio, and navbar. And a mobile view (even tested it through my browser) which scales down the padding and scales down the images a lot to fit mobile browsers.

5. All code was tested and validated through my VSCode W3C validator and had no issues.
