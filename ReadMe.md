# CS 601 Assignment 2

### Marcus Andrew Acord-Serventi

### Summary

I've only been coding for about a year now (exclusively through coursework at Boston University) so for my first real foray into HTML/CSS, I wanted to keep it simple. Basically, I want to take my résumé and translate that into a webpage.

### Assignment Overview

1. Every page has consistent navigation - it comes from a script that loads in the Navbar, which also manipulates the DOM to add the Navbar.

2. Added a Vue component on the interests page (basically the picture changes when mouseover is done).

3. The form for employers makes heavy use of Javascript. It takes the data from the form, saves it in a variable, validates it to ensure the form is completely filled out, then sends it to a .php backend server using the POST method to send me a form in my inbox.

4. HTML5 semantic elements include multiple uses of figure, figcatpion, header, nav, summary, and footer.

5. Added some color transitions for the navbar header.

6. App is hosted at https://musing-sammet-82b05e.netlify.app/home/.

7. Fleshed out a lot of different spots of the website. Added many evaluations and references.

8. All code was tested and validated through my VSCode W3C validator and had no issues. JS code was validated - 2 warnings, one stating some things aren't called (they are, by the html) and warning about using .write (which is just a warning).
